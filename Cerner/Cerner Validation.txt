our app must meet certain requirements in order to be validated.
	 The validation process has five main categories:
	 security, 
	 functionality, 
	 technical conformance,
 	 user experience and
	 operations. 
 They take these steps to ensure that the app and the vendors are in compliance
 with the standards their clients expect and deserve.

How much does it cost to submit an app?(Cerner Page)
	There is no cost associated with submitting an app. 
Cerner does charge an annual program fee for the validation of the app. 
In addition, a portion of the validation cost is retained within Cerner for cost of business.


	(Devoloper Conversation)There is a cost of being in the developer program and there is also typically a revenue 
share agreement that you would negotiate with our business team. 
These arrangements have some flexibility, so you will learn more once you engage with our business development group.
